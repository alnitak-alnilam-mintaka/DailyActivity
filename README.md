# DailyActivity

The application shows user daily activity. The data is being fetched from API and saved in the database. 
The API is not fetched every time, if the last request has been less than 12 hours ago, the data gets from the database.

I used Retrofit, Room, Koin, Courutines, MVVM for the project.
